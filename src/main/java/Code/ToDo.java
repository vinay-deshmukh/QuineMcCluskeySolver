    //Current issue is this being overwritten when making new step
    // Solved
    // by creating newStep with same attributes as this
    // then editing newStep


    // 1 Change group constructors to normal ArrayList - Maybe Not
    // 2 Make sure input is safe, doesn't work sometimes if only a single value is entered

    // 3 Override ToString for binaryRepresentation to print "-", for "9"
    // Solved
    // Used GroupSubEntries.correctString()
